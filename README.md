## General Information
- Project Overview:

> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- Data Source: The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 
## Conclusions
- While implementing the Augmentor library, observed an increase in accuracy on the training data. However, despite this improvement, the model continues to suffer from overfitting.
- By augment the model architecture by adding more layers or neurons. This expanded complexity enables the model to capture additional nuances within the data, potentially reducing overfitting.
